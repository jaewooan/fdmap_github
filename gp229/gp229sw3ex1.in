The stress perturbation is actually a boxcar rather than a step function. 
To have a decrease of stress of 3 MPa for x>10 km, set ld%S = -3, ld%x0=40, ld%R=30.
This is really a boxcar centered on x=40 km with half-width 30 km, but
because the simulation domain only extends to x=40 km, the stress is lowered
everywhere to the right of x=40-30=10 km.

The output list below controls which fields will be output (written to
disk as binary data files) and how frequently. These are not namelists
and comments are not permitted. The list is organized into multiple
sections, such as
	  I
	  iface1
	  D V S N Psi
	  0d0 1d10 10
where "I" is an arbitrary name used to help you organize output, 
"iface1" is the location of the fields to be output, "D V S N"
is a list of the fields to be output (order does not matter), and
"0d0 1d10 1" saves data between times t=0 and t=10^10 (basically 
for all time) every 1 time steps.
